Three Kinds of Keys

Primary Key - generally an integer auto-increment field

Logical key - What the outside world uses for lookup

Foreign key - generally an integer key pointing to a row in another table

Key Rules

Never use logacal key as the primary key

Logical keys can and do change, albeit slowly

Relationships that are based on matching string fields are less efficient than integers
